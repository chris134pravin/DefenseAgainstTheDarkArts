# Overview

I am making most of the labs for my Cyber Security online course (summer 2017 via Tufts University) publicly available.  The reason: more hands-on learning opportunities for those who are curious and for those who want to delve into Cyber Security --and there are many these days.  A few labs are not made publicly available because they involve real systems; they are:

* Lab 3 - Scanning and Reconnaisance
* Lab 8 - SQL Injection
* Lab 10 - Capture The Flag Game
* Lab 11 - Technical Risk Analysis and Static Analysis
