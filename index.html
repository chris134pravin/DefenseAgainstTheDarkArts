<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<h3>Week 1: Networking and Attacking Networks</h3>
<p>By the end of this week, you will be able to dissect packet captures (PCAPs), perform network reconnaissance and port scanning, extract credentials sent insecurely via plaintext over the network, detect stealthy scans and other suspicious activities on your network, understand the methods of conducting a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS).</p>

<h3>Week 2: Cryptography</h3>
<p>By the end of this week, you will be able to crack passwords on a Linux or Windows system, understand the difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, understand and use one-way hash functions, understand how Transport Layer Security (TLS) works, intercept HTTPS traffic with a proxy, understand how and how not to store users' passwords.</p>

<h3>Week 3: Web Security</h3>

<h3>Week 4: The Capture The Flag Game</h3>
<p>By the end of this week, you will be able to take advantage of a number of vulnerabilities on a live web server.</p>

<h3>Week 5: Analysis: Risk, Static, and Dynamic</h3>
<p>By the end of this week, you will be able to create technical risk analysis, be exposed to and understand the difference between CVE and CWE, use static analysis software to identify vulnerabilities, understand the difference between static and dynamic analysis.</p>

<h3>Week 6: Malware</h3>
